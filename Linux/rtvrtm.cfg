* Path of the log file.
* MBII server must have a log file and have
* g_logSync set to 1 (enabled) and
* g_logExplicit set to 3.
* seta g_logSync "1"
* seta g_logExplicit "3"
* Path is case-sensitive under Linux.

Log: PATH_TO_SERVER_LOG
*  e.g. /home/myserver/.ja/MBII/server.log

* Path of the MBII folder.
* Used to detect all BSP map files.
* Path is case-sensitive under Linux.

MBII folder: PATH_TO_MBII_FOLDER
*  e.g. /home/myserver/MBII

* Server address (IP/Host:Port).
* Used for sending messages and commands to the server.
* Do not change the IP unless the loopback (127.0.0.1) is redirecting to another or no server at all.
* IP address can be replaced with a fqdn such as localhost:29070 or server.com:29070.

Address: SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT

* Bind IP address.
* The IP address set here will be bound to send packets to the server.
* It must be an IP available within your machine.
* It's HIGHLY recommended to bind the same IP address set in the Address field.
* A fqdn such as localhost or server.com is also valid.
* Leave this field empty or commented to use whatever is available from the machine.

Bind: SERVER_IP


* Server rcon password.
* Used for sending messages and commands to the server.
* Password is case-sensitive.

Password: bla

* Flood protection system.
* The flood protection system will not allow the same player to execute one command after the
* other in rapid sequences (flooding).
* For each individual player a timer will be set once he/she uses one of RTV/RTM commands.
* The timer resets for each new command the player sends, unless the previous timer didn't expire yet.
* In this case, the command will be ignored until the timer expires.
* Voting commands are not monitored as they don't send a message back to the server.
* Players can vote as they see fit without worry of their commands being ignored.
* Admin commands will also not be monitored.
* Timer in seconds.
* OBS: Timer can be set as a floating point for fractions of a second. 
* Ex: Half a second, 0.5.
* 0 = Disabled.

Flood protection: 3

* Enable this option to force RTV/RTM to use the say command only.
* Svsay command (server messages placed in the chat box) will never be used,
* instead all messages will appear for a very short time window at the top left corner of the screen.
* This option when enabled will basically make all of RTV/RTM messages only truly
* visible through the use of the in-game console.
* 0 = Disabled (Important messages will be sent via the svsay command, while non-important messages will be
*               sent via the say command).
* 1 = Enabled (All messages will be sent via the say command only).
* Developer Note: The minimal amount of messages sent via svsay never bothered me, despite
*                 the fact that I've OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder),
*                 and I truly question whether the efficiency of raising awareness to more important
*                 events can still be maintained when players have to rely mostly in the console.
*                 This field was added to try to please all sides, although I won't recommend to
*                 enable it under any circumstance.

* When enabled, this option will kick any and all players using the protected nicknames Server and Admin.
* Case and color are disregarded and therefore any variation of those two names are disallowed.

Name protection: 1

* Default game that it will switch to when the player count drops to 0.
* Format may include one or two options.
* With one option, you must either set the default map name
* or the default mode value to switch to.
* Ex: Default game: mb2_dotf
* With two options, you must set the mode value followed by one or more blank spaces and
* then the map name.
* Ex: Default game: 0 mb2_dotf
* Mode values are:
* 0 = Open.
* 1 = Semi Authentic.

*     This value will clean the log file once its size is greater than or equal 20 megabytes.
* Compressed files will be tar.gz (gzip) with its date of compression
* appended into its name.
* Ex: log.txt-20110101000000.tar.gz (2011 01 01 00:00:00)

* will be used (absolute majority).
* Ex: Ten players are online, 50% is five players, therefore RTV will require six players to RTV.
* Ex: Eleven players are online, 50% is five and a half players. Since a half player can't vote,

* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM rate: 0

* Define the method to use to complete a RTM voting,
* and the number of minutes/rounds as the voting limit.
* 0 = Minutes (A RTM voting will complete based on the specified value in minutes).
* 1 = Rounds (A RTM voting will complete based on the specified value in rounds.
*             The round in which the voting was started will not be counted towards this value).
* Ex: RTM voting: 0 3 
*     will complete a RTM voting after 3 minutes have passed.
*     Display messages informing the players of the voting and the voting options will occur
*     at intervals of 1 minute. The final display message will occur 30 seconds before the voting completes.
* Ex: RTM voting: 1 5 
*     will complete a RTM voting after 5 rounds have passed.
*     Display messages informing the players of the voting and the voting options will occur
*     at the beginning of every round.
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM voting: 0 3

* The minimum amount of votes for a RTM voting not to fail.
* The value must be in percent (0-100)
* and must be either a floating point (20.5) or an integer (20).
* 0 = Disabled (even if no vote was registered, the RTM voting will never fail).
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM minimum votes: 20

* Controls the availability of the extend mode option "Don't change" for RTM votings.
* OBS: If this field leaves the RTM voting with only a single option remaining,
*      then a voting will not be called and a mode change will take place with the only option.
* 0 = The "Don't change" option will never be added to any RTM voting.
* 1 = The "Don't change" option will be added until the number of extensions is reached for the current mode
*     (requires a second option defining the amount of extensions allowed).
* 2 = The "Don't change" option will be added for every RTM voting.
* OBS: Second option should be preceded by one or more blank spaces.
* Ex: RTM extend: 1 2
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM extend: 2

* Time to wait before re-enabling RTM after a successful RTM voting
* in seconds (MODE CHANGE).
* 0 = Disabled.
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM successful wait time: 300

* Time to wait before re-enabling RTM after a failed RTM voting
* in seconds (NO MODE CHANGE).
* This can happen either because most players voted not to change the mode (extend),
* or because minimum votes requirement was not met.
* 0 = Disabled.
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM failed wait time: 300

* Skip RTM voting once an option can no longer be reached.
* Ex: 4 players are online and 3 voted for option 1. No other option can reach
*     option 1's value anymore, therefore it will not wait for the last player
*     to vote, skipping ahead to result instead.
* Ex: 8 players are online and 4 voted for option 1, 1 voted for option 2,
*     and 1 voted for option 3. 2 votes are remaining and no option
*     can reach option 1's value anymore, therefore skipping
*     ahead to result instead.
* If second turn is enabled, the RTM voting will
* only be skipped if the amount of votes received by the most voted option
* is greater than 50% of the total number of players,
* since every vote counts for defining a second turn.
* If the number of votes didn't reach the minimum votes requirement,
* the RTM voting will not be skipped.
* OBS: While this feature takes vote changes and unvote into account,
*      one must change his vote or unvote before the winning option becomes unreachable.
* 0 = Disabled (RTM voting will never be skipped).
* 1 = RTM voting will only be skipped if all players have voted.
* 2 = RTM voting will be skipped when an option's value is no longer reachable.
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM skip voting: 1

* Start a second turn RTM voting whether the number of options is greater than 2 and
* the amount of votes received by the most voted option is less than or equal 50% of the total number of votes.
* OBS: If two options tied and no other option received any votes, a second turn voting will not be called.
* The two most voted options will be used for the second turn voting.
* If the number of most voted options is greater than 2, then mode priority will be used to define
* the two options for second turn.
* 0 = Disabled (no second turn RTM voting will be called).
* 1 = Enabled.
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM second turn: 0

* Change mode immediately after a RTM voting or await for the next round.
* 0 = Disabled (mode will only change after a new round is detected).
* 1 = Enabled (mode will change immediately after a RTM voting).
* This field can be left empty or commented if RTM is disabled.

RTM change immediately: 1
