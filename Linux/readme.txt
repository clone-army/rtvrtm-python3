Place all files into a folder called RTV in your server.
Configure rtvrtm.cfg with your RTV settings, path to log, rconpassword.


Ensure all .sh files and the .py file have execution permissions (x).

Run start.sh to start rtv and stop.sh to stop it. You may create cron jobs to start these automatically.

The rtv script will auto-restart in case of a crash.
